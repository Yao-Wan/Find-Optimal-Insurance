# Find Optimal Insurance
A simulation model in R

## Description
- This is a group project from the *Business Analytics* course at Rady School of Management, UC San Diego
- The goal was to decide the best insurance policy to cover aircraft crash losses and incidental damage costs from four options for an airline company.
- Designed a process to simulate the number of crashes and their costs under each insurance policy.

## Data & Assumption
- Insurance policy coverage listed in tables; Assume a fixed probability of crashing.

## Methods
- Input the premium and claim into functions based on each policy’s coverage. Then create a cost function for any given number of crashes.
- Simulate the number of crashes and the damage costs over a 1-year period and a 5-year period respectively.
- Estimate the total costs to the airline under each simulation result.
- Summarize the estimations under each policy, review their distributions, and then do a sensitivity analysis.
- Consider the risk level, average costs, and the airline’s current capital structure to make a recommendation.

## Conclusion
- According to the company’s current situation, we recommended the policy HIC because its overall costs is only slightly higher than the least expensive option RCNC2 on the long-run (5-year term) but with a much better certainty.
